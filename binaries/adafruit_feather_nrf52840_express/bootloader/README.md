This binary implements extensions to the Adafruit nRF52840 bootloader. We have an outstanding PR for the
new features introduced, although at the time of writing this PR is not yet reviewed and merged into the main branch. Once this is done, it will be possible to download the binary from the Adafruit nRF52840 bootloader release page.
